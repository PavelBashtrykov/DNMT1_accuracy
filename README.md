# On the accuracy of the epigenetic copy machine - comprehensive specificity analysis of the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase

## Description
This repository contains two scripts used in Adam et al. for computation of DNA methylation levels in various flanking sequence contexts using publicaly available whole-genome bisulfite data.

## Requirements  
To run the script you have to preinstall following tools and add them to `PATH`

* `bedtools` https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2
* `WGBS2Flanks` https://github.com/PavelBashtrykov/WGBS2Flanks
